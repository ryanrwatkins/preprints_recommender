# PreprintScout

PreprintScout is a tool designed to help researchers (including student researchers) discover preprints that can inform current and future research endeavors. It provides a useful tool for exploring recent preprints, tracking updates, and curating a personalized library.

## Features

- **Recommender**: Get recent preprints recommended on your personalized background and interests.
- **LLM and NLP**: Use your choice of LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini), as well as NLP methods (i.e., costine-similarity of embeddings), to get the most useful recommendations.
- **Interdiscipinary**: Explore research from fields *close* and *far* from your home dischipline based on your preferences.


## Installation

```bash
    pip install preprintscout
or
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PreprintScout.git

```

## Dependencies
##### arxiv>=2.1.3
##### beautifulsoup4>=4.12.3
##### google-generativeai>=0.7.0
##### langdetect>=1.0.9
##### openai>=1.35.7
##### pandas>=2.2.2
##### pytz>=2024.1
##### Requests>=2.32.3
##### retry>=0.9.2
##### scikit_learn>=1.4.2

## Run the application:
```bash
import preprintscout

preprintscout(your_short_biography, huggingface_api_key, openai_api_key="xxxxxx", google_api_key=None, interdisciplinary="3", output_path="/path/to/output")
```
## Configuration

### Required -- Write a short (150 to 200 words) biographical statement about your research, interests, academic background, and so forth.
### This is used for creating recommendations that will be of interest to you!

```bash
your_short_biography = "I am a professor of engineering management. My research is in the application of artificial intelligence in managing engineering systems for electical vehicles... "
```

#### Required -- For recommendations include an API key from your HuggingFace account. For security you can also store this as an environment variable. For example, "${HF_API_KEY}"
```bash
huggingface_api_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

#### Required -- Must have one, either an OpenAI or Google Gemini API key.
- ##### Optional -- For LLM based recommendations include an API key from your OpenAI account. For security you can also store this as an environment variable. For example, "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```bash
openai_api_key =  "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
- ##### Optional -- For LLM based recommendations include an API key from your OpenAI account. For security you can also store this as an environment variable. For example, "${GOOGLE_API_KEY}"
```bash
google_api_key =  "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

#### Optional --  Using 1 to 4, indicate your interest in research outside of your home discipline
- ##### 1 = connected disciplines
- ##### 2 = adjacent disciplines (default)
- ##### 3 = tangential disciplines
- ##### 4 = peripheral disciplines

```bash
interdisciplinary = "3"
```

#### Optional -- You can save JSON copies of recommendations include the path.
```bash
output_path = "/path/to/output"
```
##### This will create the directory if it doesn't exist yet. Be sure that has a the leading slash. For instance, on a Mac you could have ""/Users/your_name/recommendations/preprints"

#### Here is a complete example (note that opetional arguments have to be labeled in the function):
```bash
import preprintscout as pps

your_short_biography = "I am a professor of engineering management. My research is in the application of artificial intelligence in managing engineering systems for electical vehicles... "
huggingface_api_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

pps(your_short_biography, huggingface_api_key, openai_api_key="xxxxxx", google_api_key=None, interdisciplinary="3", output_path="/path/to/output")
```
## Output
#### The return is a JSON file grouped by type of recommendation, with 5 recommendations for each category. Here an example with one recommendation for each category and reduced descriptions.

- ##### arxiv_llm_recs = recommendations of recent preprints from arxiv.org determined by your selected LLM and based on your profile description.
- ##### osf_phil_llm_recs = recommendations of recent preprints from OSF.io and PhilArchive.org determined by your selected LLM and based on your profile description.
- ##### arxiv_cosine_ranked = recommendations of recent preprints from arxiv.org determined by using cosine-similary of the article abstract and your profile description.
- ##### osf_phil_cosine_ranked = recommendations of recent preprints from OSF.io and PhilArchive.org determined by using cosine-similary of the article abstract and your profile description.
- ##### interdisciplinary_ranked = a reranking of all recent prepreints (arxiv, OSF, and PhilArchive) based on the semanitic distance from your home discipline and your interdiscplinary interest setting.
- ##### score = cosine-similarity of the article abstract and your profile description.
- ##### dissim_value = Semanitic distance between the article abstract and your home discipline.

## Troubleshooting

#### If you encounter issues importing 'preprintscout' after installing the package, follow these steps to find the installation path and update the 'PYTHONPATH'.

#### Step 1: Verify and find the installation path:
##### Use the '>>> pip show preprintscout' command and note the location. For example, if the location is /Users/yourusername/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages, you will use this path.

```bash
pip show preprintscout
```

#### Step 2: Update PYTHONPATH:
##### Temporarily update PYTHONPATH in your terminal session:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/yourusername/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
```
