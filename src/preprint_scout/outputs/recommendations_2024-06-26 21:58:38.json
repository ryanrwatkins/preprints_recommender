                "Video generation is a challenging yet pivotal task in various industries,\nsuch as gaming, e-commerce, and advertising. One significant unresolved aspect\nwithin T2V is the effective visualization of text within generated videos.\nDespite the progress achieved in Text-to-Video~(T2V) generation, current\nmethods still cannot effectively visualize texts in videos directly, as they\nmainly focus on summarizing semantic scene information, understanding, and\ndepicting actions. While recent advances in image-level visual text generation\nshow promise, transitioning these techniques into the video domain faces\nproblems, notably in preserving textual fidelity and motion coherence. In this\npaper, we propose an innovative approach termed Text-Animator for visual text\nvideo generation. Text-Animator contains a text embedding injection module to\nprecisely depict the structures of visual text in generated videos. Besides, we\ndevelop a camera control module and a text refinement module to improve the\nstability of generated visual text by controlling the camera movement as well\nas the motion of visualized text. Quantitative and qualitative experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of our approach to the accuracy of\ngenerated visual text over state-of-the-art video generation methods.

                "The development of 2D foundation models for image segmentation has been\nsignificantly advanced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, achieving\nsimilar success in 3D models remains a challenge due to issues such as\nnon-unified data formats, lightweight models, and the scarcity of labeled data\nwith diverse masks. To this end, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation model\n(Point-SAM) focusing on point clouds. Our approach utilizes a transformer-based\nmethod, extending SAM to the 3D domain. We leverage part-level and object-level\nannotations and introduce a data engine to generate pseudo labels from SAM,\nthereby distilling 2D knowledge into our 3D model. Our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models on several indoor and outdoor benchmarks and\ndemonstrates a variety of applications, such as 3D annotation.

With the rapid development\nof machine learning models today, the performance of existing machine learning\nmodels has quickly reached state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks\nrelated to natural language processing, including natural language inference\ntasks.

To remain attractive and challenging in the research of natural\nlanguage inference for Vietnamese, in this paper, we introduce the adversarial\nNLI dataset to the NLP research community with the name ViANLI. This data set\ncontains more than 10K premise-hypothesis pairs and is built by a continuously\nadjusting process to obtain the most out of the patterns generated by the\nannotators. ViANLI dataset has brought many difficulties to many current SOTA\nmodels when the accuracy of the most powerful model on the test set only\nreached 48.4%.

                "Humans\u2019 ability to rapidly identify appropriate actions in new situations is critical for survival and functional behavior. This skill develops through trial and error where humans get rewards for their actions, and through few attempts, learn the optimal subsequent action. Here, we used computerised reasoning games to test developmental changes in whether and how rewards affect trial-and-error learning. School-aged children (5- to 15-year-olds) played online games in which they had to access their physical knowledge and predict physical events to succeed. We systematically changed the rewards so children received either high positive rewards for success, high negative rewards for failure, or no reward. We evaluated differences between the groups in terms of performance (success rate, attempt and attempt duration) and strategy (which tools were selected and where they were positioned). Children in the Negative-Rewards group showed significant improvement with age\u2014they succeeded more, used fewer attempts, and applied more efficient strategies. In contrast, we did not find developmental changes in the Positive-Rewards or No Reward groups. Our findings demonstrate a developmental shift in how rewards affect trial-and-error, and suggest that negative rewards emerge as a powerful cognitive reinforcer during late childhood.",

Several psychological variables have been linked to the experience of stressful events. However, a profound understanding of the process of stress generation is still missing. In this article, we outline how the integration of theory, evidence, and methods from personality psychology and clinical research may help to address three open questions in stress generation theory: What are the mechanisms of the stress generation process? Which stressors are the result of the stress generation process? How does stress generation unfold over time? Building on decades of research on person-environment transactions, we present an integrative theoretical model that provides a systematic framework of the mechanisms, consequences, and time scale of the stress generation process.

                "The cognitive ability to mental time travel allows people to project themselves backward and forward in time. Research has shown that anticipating and envisioning possible future events, and imagining ourselves experiencing those events, has many implications for health, finance, and environmental protection. While many public policies in these domains consider events that may occur decades ahead in the future, current evidence suggests we typically consider a much shorter temporal distance when spontaneously thinking about the future. Here we examined whether this typical short temporal distance would vary if individuals were primed to think about the future of the natural environment in a between-subjects experiment with online respondents (212 MTurkers). We compared responses from individuals randomly asked to think about the future in general (control condition) to those asked to think about the future of the natural environment (main experimental condition) or the future of the work environment (contrasting experimental condition). Results confirmed that individuals typically think in very short term into the future, with temporal distance between 1 and 5 years. Supporting our intuition, results showed that individuals asked to think about the future of the natural environment were statistically more likely to think longer term (10 years or more) compared to those in the other conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings to time\u2010scale mismatches in policy making.",

                "Social touch plays a vital role in human development, communication, and general well-being. However, it is unclear how alterations in sensory perception (i.e. detection and discrimination of stimuli) shape our experience of social touch, alongside contextual factors such as gender and culture. Using a well-validated battery of psychophysically applied tactile tasks and a novel social touch paradigm, we demonstrate that poorer tactile discrimination is associated with lower social touch preference in two cross-cultural cohorts, in the UK and Singapore. We also show that female participants in both cohorts rated different-gender touch as less pleasant than males, and that Singaporean adults had lower preferences for social vs. non-social touch compared with UK adults. We conclude that while cultural differences were observed at the top-down level, the bottom-up perceptual contributions of tactile sensitivity to the context-dependent preference of touch could reflect a conserved biological mechanism.",

                "Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle facial movements that occur spontaneously\nwhen people try to conceal the real emotions. Micro-expression recognition\n(MER) is crucial in many fields, including criminal analysis and psychotherapy.\nHowever, MER is challenging since MEs have low intensity and ME datasets are\nsmall in size. To this end, a three-stream temporal-shift attention network\nbased on self-knowledge distillation (SKD-TSTSAN) is proposed in this paper.\nFirstly, to address the low intensity of ME muscle movements, we utilize\nlearning-based motion magnification modules to enhance the intensity of ME\nmuscle movements. Secondly, we employ efficient channel attention (ECA) modules\nin the local-spatial stream to make the network focus on facial regions that\nare highly relevant to MEs. In addition, temporal shift modules (TSMs) are used\nin the dynamic-temporal stream, which enables temporal modeling with no\nadditional parameters by mixing ME motion information from two different\ntemporal domains. Furthermore, we introduce self-knowledge distillation (SKD)\ninto the MER task by introducing auxiliary classifiers and using the deepest\nsection of the network for supervision, encouraging all blocks to fully explore\nthe features of the training set. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted\non four ME datasets: CASME II, SAMM, MMEW, and CAS(ME)3. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our SKD-TSTSAN outperforms other existing methods and\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance.

                "Stress generation refers to a phenomenon in which individuals contribute to the generation or exacerbation of stressors in their own lives. Several psychological variables have been linked to the experience of stressful events. However, a profound understanding of the process of stress generation is still missing. In this article, we outline how the integration of theory, evidence, and methods from personality psychology and clinical research may help to address three open questions in stress generation theory: What are the mechanisms of the stress generation process? Which stressors are the result of the stress generation process? How does stress generation unfold over time? Building on decades of research on person-environment transactions, we present an integrative theoretical model that provides a systematic framework of the mechanisms, consequences, and time scale of the stress generation process. We close with recommendations for future research using intensive longitudinal designs, comprehensive assessments of environmental experiences, and causal inference strategies.",

                "Building on both modern and classical psychotherapy theories, I propose the Self-Other Dynamics (SOD) approach. This transtheoretical approach integrates key elements of patients' self-states, therapists' interventions, and their dyadic interactions, with the goal of identifying adaptive and maladaptive dynamics associated with psychotherapy outcomes. The vast number of self-states, the dynamic contexts in which they may emerge, and interventions that therapists may utilize to address them have presented a formidable challenge that research methodologies have struggled to tackle until recently. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the development of large language models (LLMs), offer substantial promise in addressing this challenge. The goal of this project is to leverage LLM capabilities to automatically detect a patient's self-state and recommend the most appropriate intervention to enhance their well-being. To achieve this goal, I developed the SOD coding scheme, which integrates micro-level processes of patients, therapists, and dyads that are considered central according to a wide range of therapeutic approaches. Using this scheme, patient-therapist dialogues will be annotated speech turn by speech turn. Initially, a subset of the data will be manually annotated using the SOD coding scheme. Subsequently, LLMs will be trained to automatically annotate a larger dataset, enabling the scaling up of categories and providing clinical insights into adaptive and maladaptive self-other dynamics. This paper describes the work in progress, beginning with the background of the SOD theoretical approach, followed by detailed guidelines for the coding scheme. Preliminary experiments indicate that LLMs can reliably annotate psychotherapy data at a level comparable to human reliability.",

                "The percentage of women in academia is still lower than what would be expected statistically, especially in the sciences and among faculty (tenured professors). Theories on the \u201cglass-ceiling effect\u201d suggest that men form exclusive professional networks among other men, while women remain systematically outside. With this paper, we aim to shed some light on this by exploiting a dataset that tracks sensor-based interaction behavior at four academic conferences in the field of Computational Social Science. We look at the number of minutes junior academics interact with tenured professors during the lunch and coffee breaks of these conferences. If glass-ceiling theory holds, we expect to see that female junior academics show fewer interactions to seniors, especially to male seniors. We also expect to see that junior women interact more often than junior men with lower-level academics. While we indeed find evidence for this last hypothesis, we do not find evidence for the first two expectations. We find that junior women show more interactions then men to senior scholars, especially to male professors, but also to female professors. Overall, we do not find evidence for one important mechanism of the glass-ceiling effect, namely, that male gatekeepers exclusively interact with males only, at least not at a conference setting and with this type of measure.",

                "The cognitive ability to mental time travel allows people to project themselves backward and forward in time. Research has shown that anticipating and envisioning possible future events, and imagining ourselves experiencing those events, has many implications for health, finance, and environmental protection. While many public policies in these domains consider events that may occur decades ahead in the future, current evidence suggests we typically consider a much shorter temporal distance when spontaneously thinking about the future. Here we examined whether this typical short temporal distance would vary if individuals were primed to think about the future of the natural environment in a between-subjects experiment with online respondents (212 MTurkers). We compared responses from individuals randomly asked to think about the future in general (control condition) to those asked to think about the future of the natural environment (main experimental condition) or the future of the work environment (contrasting experimental condition). Results confirmed that individuals typically think in very short term into the future, with temporal distance between 1 and 5 years. Supporting our intuition, results showed that individuals asked to think about the future of the natural environment were statistically more likely to think longer term (10 years or more) compared to those in the other conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings to time\u2010scale mismatches in policy making.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of a pilot blended digital intervention aimed at promoting behavior change towards sustainable diets. \nMethods: We conducted a series of ABA (A phase: 2-week baseline evaluation; B phase: 22-week intervention; A phase: 24-week post-intervention, follow-up) N-of-1 trials over a year. Intervention involved (i) text messages containing brief educational information, motivational messages or links to recipes, and (ii) individualized online feedback sessions. Intensive longitudinal quantitative data on eating behaviors were collected daily for 15 weeks distributed over the year. A weekly composite score for sustainable diets was calculated to evaluate changes in the overall dietary quality, considering health and environmental sustainability. Qualitative data was collected through three individual semi-structured interviews: at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and 6 months later, to gain further insight into the study objectives. Analyses were performed at both the group and individual levels.\nResults: This pilot trial involved 12 participants. Feasibility and acceptability were high, with a 100% retention rate over a year, 75% attendance at all feedback sessions, and an average response rate of 86% to the intensive longitudinal eating behavior questionnaires. At the group level, the intervention had a positive and significant effect on the overall diet composition. Compared to baseline, and on a 10-point scale, participants showed a significant increase of 1.25 and 1.85 points during the intervention and follow-up phases, respectively. At the individual level, 92% of the participants demonstrated a significant increase in daily fruit and vegetable consumption between the baseline and follow-up phases, and 58% significantly reduced their intake of red and processed meat as well as ultra-processed foods. Beyond diet composition, participants reported improvements in other crucial aspects of sustainable diets, including reducing food waste, opting for minimally packaged and in-season foods, and prioritizing food from fair sources, as assessed with the qualitative interviews.\nConclusion: This pilot study provides valuable knowledge for designing, optimizing, and implementing future large-scale interventions targeting individual behavior change for sustainable diets in a holistic way.",

In other words, death is not a fate of any kind, or something that supervenes each individual. Instead, everyone decides when to die. Two major venues can be distinguished, thus: people decide when to die either because they feel relieved and have the sensation that they have accomplished what they could or planned, somehow; or else, they die because they must give up and need a gate of scape. Briefly said, death is not a choice, but a decision. The rationale for the claim lies in epigenetics. Epigenetics points out to the fact that nature and culture are one and the same thing. The election for death is, after all, it appears, a matter of freedom.",

The proposal touches on complex topics from multiple disciplines, including physics, philosophy of mind, theology, and metaphysics.\n\nThe core argument in the following proposal\n\n1. Fundamental uncertainty about energy: Despite our ability to measure and mathematically describe energy, its intrinsic nature or \"essence\" remains elusive in physics. This gap in our understanding opens the door for metaphysical inquiry.\n2. Energy as a manifestation of divine power: The proposal suggests viewing energy as an emanation or actualization of God's power. This perspective offers a metaphysical explanation for energy's fundamental yet mysterious nature in physics.\n3. Consciousness as a fundamental aspect: The framework posits consciousness, alongside energy, as a fundamental aspect of reality, rooted in God's nature. This addresses the hard problem of consciousness by making it as fundamental as physical properties.\n4. Bridging mind and matter: By grounding both physical (energy) and mental (consciousness) aspects in God's nature, the proposal offers a unique solution to the mind-body problem.\n5. Reframing creation: Instead of creation ex nihilo, this model suggests creation as an actualization of God's eternal attributes. This addresses metaphysical challenges associated with something coming from absolute nothingness.\n6. Divine immanence and transcendence: The framework provides a way to understand God's presence within the universe (immanence) through energy, while maintaining His existence beyond it (transcendence).\n7. Compatibility with science and scripture: The proposal aims to be compatible with scientific observations while also aligning with biblical concepts and verses traditionally associated with creation.\n8. Addressing philosophical challenges: This framework offers novel approaches to longstanding philosophical issues, including the nature of space, the Trinity, and the problem of evil.\n\nThe argument posits that by viewing energy and consciousness as fundamental aspects of God's nature, we can create a coherent metaphysical framework that bridges theology, philosophy, and science. This approach offers potential resolutions to various philosophical and theological challenges while remaining open to scientific understanding.",
